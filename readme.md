# Sequence symmetry analysis in R

This project is an effort to develop general functions to perform sequence
symmetry analyses using R.
Dependencies are `data.table` and `ggplot2` packages for fast data manipulation
and plotting.

The code is tested prior to each commit but it cannot be guaranteed that it is
free of errors. If you make use of the code in research projects *please*
validate the numbers produced by the functions.

The file `tests/ssa-tests.R` is a very short demonstration of how to use the
functions included in this project.
